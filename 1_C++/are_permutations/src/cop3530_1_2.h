/*
    Are permutations

    Given an array of strings strs such that each string only consists of lowercase letters, 
    write a method that returns true if they are all permutations of each other. 
    Two strings strs[i] and strs[j] are permutations of each other if the characters 
    of strs[i] can be rearranged to match strs[j].

    Example 1:
        Input: strs = ["abba", "bbaa", "aabb"]
        Output: true
        Explanation: All the strings are permutations of each other.

    Example 2:
        Input: strs = ["abc", "abbc"]
        Output: false
        Explanation: The strings are not permutations of each other.

    Example 3:
        Input: strs = ["gator", "rotag", "sator"]
        Output: false
        Explanation: The strings are not permutations of each other.
    
    Example 4:
        Input: strs = ["shoes", "sheso", "hesos", "shooes", "shoe"]
        Output: false
        Explanation: The strings are not permutations of each other.

    Example 5:
        Input: strs = [""]
        Output: true
        Explanation: The strings are permutations of each other.

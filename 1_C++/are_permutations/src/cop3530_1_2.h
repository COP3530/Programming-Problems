/*
    Are permutations

    In this problem, you are given an array of strings strs such that each string only consists of lowercase letters. 
    Two strings strs[i] and strs[j] are permutations of each other if all the characters of strs[j] can be rearranged
    such that strs[i] == strs[j]. Write a method that returns true if all the strings in strs are permutations of each other.

    Example 1:
        Input: strs = ["abba", "bbaa", "aabb"]
        Output: true
        Explanation: All the strings are permutations of each other.

    Example 2:
        Input: strs = ["abc", "abbc"]
        Output: false
        Explanation: The strings are not permutations of each other.

    Example 3:
        Input: strs = ["gator", "rotag", "sator"]
        Output: false
        Explanation: The strings are not permutations of each other.
    
    Example 4:
        Input: strs = ["shoes", "sheso", "hesos", "shooes", "shoe"]
        Output: false
        Explanation: The strings are not permutations of each other.

    Example 5:
        Input: strs = [""]
        Output: true
        Explanation: The strings are permutations of each other.

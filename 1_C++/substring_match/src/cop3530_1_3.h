/*
    Substring Match

    Suppose you are given an vector of strings, str. Return all strings in str that 
    are a substring of any other string in str only if all returned strings have the 
    same length. You can return the answer in a vector of matched strings in any order.
    Definition: A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

    Example:
    Input: str = [“place”, “misplacement”, “great”, “greatest”]
    Output: [“place”, “great”]
    Explanation: “place” is a substring of “misplacement” and “great” is a substring 
    of “greatest”. Both substrings “place” and “great” have the same length.

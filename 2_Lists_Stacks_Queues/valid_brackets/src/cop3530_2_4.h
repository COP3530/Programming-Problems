/*
    Valid Brackets

    There exist four types of brackets; the parentheses or round brackets ( ), curly or brace 
    brackets { }, square or box brackets [ ], and angle brackets < >. Suppose you are given a 
    string s containing just the characters (, ), {, }, [, ], <, >. The input string s is valid 
    if the brackets are matched by the same type of bracket and in proper order. Determine if 
    the input string s is valid. Return true if valid, and false otherwise.

    Example:
    Input: s = “()(”
    Output: false
    Explanation: Although there is a proper pair of parentheses, there does exist an opening 
    parenthesis that is not closed by another.

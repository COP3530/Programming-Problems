/*
 Evaluate Postfix

 Postfix notation, or reverse polish notation, is a way of writing mathematical 
 expressions such that the operands of an expression are listed before the operator.
 For example, the expression 1+2 would be written as 1 2 + in postfix notation.
 Note, that infix and postfix notations express the same equations differently, 
 but they will both always have the same value.

 You are given a vector of strings postfix such that each element represents an 
 integer or an operator (+, -, *, /, %). Evaluate the expression represented by 
 postfix and return the value.

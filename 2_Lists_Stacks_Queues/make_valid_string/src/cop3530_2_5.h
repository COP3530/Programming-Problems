/*
	Make Valid String

	You are given a string `str` that contains only the characters 
	`(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`. The string `str` is valid if:

		- each opening bracket is closed by a matching bracket
		- each bracket is closed in the correct order
		- each closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket

	If `str` is not valid then add the minimum number of correct 
	brackets to make `str` valid and return the new string, else return `str`.

	Sample Test:
	Input: str = "("
	Output: "()"
	Explanation: The opening parenthesis, must be closed by a matching closed parenthesis

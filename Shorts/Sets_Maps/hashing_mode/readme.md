## Problem Statement
In a collection of numbers, the mode is the value which occurs the most number of times.

Write a function to find the mode of a nonempty vector of integers.

If there are multiple modes, return the one with the least value.

### Example 1:
> **Input:** `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3]` \
> **Output:** `3` \
> **Explanation:** 3 occurs more times than any other element in the list.
### Example 2:
> **Input:** `[6, 4, 9, 6, 6, 4, 9, 4, 9]` \
> **Output:** `4` \
> **Explanation:** 4, 6, and 9 each occur three times, so all are modes. 4 has the least value out of the modes, so the result is 4.

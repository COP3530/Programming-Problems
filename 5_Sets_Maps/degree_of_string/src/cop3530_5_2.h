/*
	Degree of a String

	Given a string `str`, the degree of this string is defined 
	as the maximum frequency of any one of its characters.

	Your task is to find the minimum length of a contiguous 
	substring of `str`, that has the same degree as `str`.

	Sample Test Case

	Input: str = “fl1pthat”
	Output: 4
	Explanation: The maximum frequency is 2, and the smallest contiguous 
	substring that has frequency 2 is “that” which has length 4.
